In src/custom_input.in

Changed portions:
For LI region change the variable: decomp_assemblies_ax then, assembly_width
For increasing time without changing LI: change cai and fai

for increasing time: increase segments per track parameter. 
on 72 cores: increasing the parameter by 120 increased the time by 5 seconds.

increase cai only to reduce mem% seen from htop, i.e. make it more cache dependent.
